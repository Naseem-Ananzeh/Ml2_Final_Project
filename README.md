- Naseem Ananzeh

## Datasets
- Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
- Mall Customers Segmentation Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying advanced unsupervised learning techniques and anomaly detection methods on real-world datasets. We will analyze, cluster, visualize, validate, and extract insights from complex, high-dimensional data.

1. Dimensionality Reduction
Applied Methods :- ( PCA , t-SNE )

2. Clustering Analysis
Applied Methods :- ( KMeans , KMeans++ , MiniBatchKMeans , DBSCAN )

3. Anomaly Detection ( Credit_Card Dataset )
- Applied Methods :- ( Isolation Forest , OneClassSVM )
- Evaluated by using :- (Precision, Recall, F1-Score , Confusion Matrix)
- Analyzed How unsupervised models detect fraud vs. true labels. , 
- and which method performs better, and why.
